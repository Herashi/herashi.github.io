title: "The PROviding Mental health Precision Treatment (PROMPT) Precision Health Study"
collection: projects
excerpt: "The overall goal of PROMPT is to reduce the burden of depression by 1) increasing capacity in the mental health care system through expanding use of mobile technology-delivered interventions and 2) accelerating recovery from mental illness by better matching patients to pharmacological, psychological, and mobile-based treatments."

Depression, sleep disorders, addiction, and anxiety are leading and growing causes of disability, productivity loss, and premature mortality globally. The number of behavioral health clinicians available to provide face-to-face, traditional care, however, is woefully inadequate to meet the growing need. Further, a substantial proportion of patients who receive traditional care do not get better. With inadequate evidence to meaningfully guide treatment decisions and little objective measures of mental health symptoms available, choice of treatment is often based on clinician preference and simple heuristics.

More than any other advancement in the past decades, mobile technology has the potential to address the dual problems of limited clinical capacity and inadequate and untimely data. Mobile technology holds the potential to both track and intervene in depressive symptoms in powerful ways not previously possible. Little is known about how to derive the greatest value from this technology, however, be it targeting patients most likely to benefit or providing clinicians with the most useful information from the data collection process.

The overall goal of PROMPT is to reduce the burden of depression by 1) increasing capacity in the mental health care system through expanding use of mobile technology-delivered interventions and 2) accelerating recovery from mental illness by better matching patients to pharmacological, psychological, and mobile-based treatments. To do so, investigators will assess the independent and combined effectiveness of two kinds of mobile technology interventions for four weeks, among patients on the waitlist for traditional care. They will use machine learning to identify key predictors of treatment response from mobile technology, genomic, and environmental data collected from patients receiving either mobile technology interventions while on the wait list for care, or traditional face-to-face psychotherapy and/or medication treatment
