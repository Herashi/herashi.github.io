My doctoral research focuses on developing robust and efficient methodologies to evaluate causal excursion effects in sequential, adaptive intervention experiments. My work leverages new experimental approaches, such as micro-randomized trials (MRTs), as well as causal inference and supervised learning methods. The general theme of my research is to advance a more relevant, valid, and precise assessment of digital health intervention effects in the new context of time-varying treatments and repeated outcomes with clustering, interference, and high-dimensional nuisance parameters.

I was also part of the Virtual AppLication-supported ENvironment To INcrease Exercise [(VALENTINE) Study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04587882), which aims to evaluate a digital intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low- and moderate risk patients, integrating a mobile application with physiologic and contextual information from wearables to provide incremental support to patients.


Since September 2023, Iâ€™ve been working on projects focused on developing data integration methods for Mendelian Randomization and conditional independence testing for Granger Causality.
