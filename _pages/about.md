## About Me

Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Statistical Laboratory, [Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS)](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge working with Dr. [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/). I obtained my Ph.D.in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) advised by Dr. [Walter Dempsey](https://walterhdempsey.com/) and Dr. [Zhenke Wu](https://zhenkewu.com/).

### Research Theme:

My doctoral research focuses on developing robust and efficient methodologies to evaluate causal excursion effects in sequential, adaptive intervention experiments. My work leverages new experimental approaches, such as micro-randomized trials (MRTs), as well as causal inference and supervised learning methods. The general theme of my research is to advance a more relevant, valid, and precise assessment of digital health intervention effects in the new context of time-varying treatments and repeated outcomes with clustering, interference, and high-dimensional nuisance parameters. 

### Keywords: 

Causal Inference; Causal Excursion Effect; Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions; Micro-randomized Trials; Mobile Health; Time-varying Moderation Effect; Double robustness.
