## About Me


Hello! I am a **Senior Research Fellow** in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science), working with Prof. [Karla Diaz Ordaz](https://kdiazordaz.github.io/).

Before joining UCL, I was a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** in the Statistical Laboratory, [DPMMS](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/), at the **University of Cambridge**, where I worked with Prof. [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/).

I received my **Ph.D.** from the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), co-advised by Dr. [Walter Dempsey](https://walterhdempsey.com/) and Dr. [Zhenke Wu](https://zhenkewu.com/).
