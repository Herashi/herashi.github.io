## About Me

Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Statistical Laboratory, [Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS)](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge working with Dr. [Qingyuan Zhao](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/). I obtained my Ph.D.in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) advised by Dr. [Walter Dempsey](https://walterhdempsey.com/) and Dr. [Zhenke Wu](https://zhenkewu.com/).
